      <h2 class="center">WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE LIVING?</h2>
      <p>
        Sustainable living is a lifestyle that aims to reduce one’s
        environmental impact, in ways that are sustainable both for the Earth
        and for the person. So while pledging to never run your faucet again may
        be sustainable for the planet, it probably wouldn’t be sustainable for
        you personally (or for your friends who would be subject to your poor
        hygiene).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are endless ways to live sustainably, including: reducing your use
        of resources, composting, relying on clean energy sources, reducing your
        consumption of single-use plastic, eating less animal products, shopping
        for clothing and other items sustainably, buying local, and more.
      </p>

        SUSTAINABLE LIVING VS ZERO WASTE --- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sustainable living and the zero-waste movement have similar goals and
        many similar lifestyle patterns, but are a little bit different. Those
        trying to live sustainably aim to lower their overall environmental
        impact in a variety of ways, while the primary focus of those living
        zero-waste is typically to reduce the amount of trash they produce,
        namely single-use plastic.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, someone whose primary goal is to live zero-waste and
        produce zero trash may be comfortable eating meat that was purchased
        without any plastic. But someone aiming to live a well-rounded,
        sustainable lifestyle may consider the bigger picture (aka the massive
        environmental impact and ethical concerns of animal agriculture) and opt
        for a plant-based meal instead, even if it is packaged in plastic.
      </p>

      <h3 class="center">How to start sustainable living ?</h3>

      <p>
        There are numerous ways to start living more sustainably — and a
        sustainable lifestyle looks different for everyone. Areas where you can
        reduce your impact include:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Eating a plant based diet.</th>
          <th>Composting</th>
          <th>Reducing single used plastic</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>
              Animal products like meat, dairy, and eggs are the highest-impact
              foods on Earth. To lower your diet’s footprint, consider
              transitioning to a vegan diet, or at least eating more vegan
              meals. Along with this, it’s important to focus on wasting less
              food.

          </td>
          <td>
            <p>
              Instead of sending food scraps (that includes things like
              vegetable peels, avocado pits, and spoiled leftovers) to landfill,
              start composting. Composting is the process of returning anything
              that comes from nature to the earth, and letting it biodegrade
              into soil. Setting up a compost bin is super easy if you have a
              backyard, but it’s also possible if you live in an apartment or in
              a city with no yard.
            </p>

              If you drive a gas-powered car every day, consider alternatives
              with lower emissions if they are available to you. For example,
              try walking, riding a bike, taking public transportation,
              carpooling, or investing in an electric or hybrid car when you
              need a new one. Additionally, many environmentalists have given up
              flying in airplanes (such as Greta Thunberg) due to the high
              environmental footprint, so consider traveling by train instead of
              by air when possible.

              The most sustainable form of shopping is not to shop at all — and
              the second most sustainable form (and more realistic form) of
              shopping is shopping secondhand. Before buying anything new, check
              out your local thrift store, websites and apps like Poshmark,
              Craigslist, or eBay, or your local Buy Nothing group on Facebook.
              When it comes to items that you can’t buy secondhand, seek out
              companies that make products from natural or recycled materials
              while following sustainable business practices.

      <h3 class="center">IMPORTANCE</h3>
      <p>
        With climate change becoming a more serious problem every day, it’s now
        more important than ever for people to do their part to reduce their
        environmental impact. Demanding lawmakers and corporations institute
        laws or policies to help with that is extremely important, but lowering
        your personal impact can make a huge difference as well.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="impact" class="box">
      <h2 class="center">IMPACT OF SUSTAINABLE LIVING?</h2>
      <p>
        The average American produces 4.4 pounds of trash per day, according to
        the EPA — that comes out to more than 1,600 pounds per year. So by
        transitioning to a zero-waste lifestyle, you could literally save
        thousands of pounds of trash from going to landfills, where it would
        emit harmful greenhouse gases.
      </p>
      <p>
        By eating a vegan or plant-based diet, every year, you can save: 401,500
        gallons of water, 14,600 pounds of grain; 10,950 square feet of forest,
        7,300 pounds of CO2, and 365 animal lives, according to the Vegan
        Calculator.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it may seem like small changes such as going zero-waste or vegan
        won’t really make a difference, looking at those statistics make it
        clear that sustainability lifestyle changes can be powerful.

      <h2 class="center">WHAT PEOPLE CAN DO?</h2>
      <ol type="I">
        <li>
          <h3>Grow food</h3>
          <p>
            Growing some of your own food. Start a vegetable or herb garden, and
            plant a fruit tree or even two. This will save tonnes of transport
            greenhouse gases because the food will be right outside your door.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Preserve food</h3>
          <p>
            Did you know that preserving food by pickling, drying or bottling is
            better than freezing in a refrigerator.
          </p>
          <p>Why? Because it uses less energy than the refrigerator.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Reduse waste</h3>
          <p>
            Gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are released into the
            atmosphere from waste disposal sites. This adds to the greenhouse
            effect and global warming. Dangerous materials also leaking from
            rubbish dumps and pollute waterways and soil from rubbish dumps.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Insulate houses</h3>
          <p>
            Insulate houses to reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and
            cool the house. Trees planted around the house will shade it during
            hot weather.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people are covering roofs with living plants to stop the house
            warming or cooling too quickly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Use Public Transport</h3>
          <p>
            Use public transport whenever you can to reduce the amount of gases
            from petrol powered cars. Ride your bike!
